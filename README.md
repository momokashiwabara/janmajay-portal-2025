# Janmajay Portal 2025: Gaming in Cloud Activity

## 🌟 Overview

The **Janmajay Portal 2025** is a web-based gaming portal designed as part of a *Gaming in Cloud* activity or project. Its goal is to provide a central, lightweight hub for various browser-based games and interactive activities, built primarily using standard web technologies.

This project emphasizes clean front-end architecture and is easily deployable to any static web hosting or cloud service.

## ✨ Features

- **Centralized Game Hub:** A single `index.html` acts as the main portal for navigating between different activities.  
- **Modular Game Structure:** Each game is self-contained within its own directory (e.g., `games/snake`).  
- **Classic Snake Game:** Includes a fully functional implementation of the classic arcade game.  
- **Pure Web Technology:** Built entirely using HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript for maximum compatibility and minimal dependencies.
